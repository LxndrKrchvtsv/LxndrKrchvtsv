						Until the age of 7, I lived in the{' '}
						<strong>village of Ugut, this is a place in Western Siberia.</strong> Then,

						I began my journey into frontend development in 2016. I realized that
						creating websites is a realm where one can materialize their thoughts and
						ideas.{' '}
						<strong>
							Each website is a distinct universe, and you're the creator,
							transferring from the world of ideas to the material, digital world.
						</strong>
					</p>

					<p className={Styles.paragraph}>
						<strong>
							This is an opportunity for self-expression and defining one's

							well-structured, comprehensible code.

						In 2017, I stumbled upon a website of a freelancer, developed using{' '}
						<strong>React.</strong>
						That's when I understood that this is what I needed. However, my{' '}
						<strong>JavaScript</strong>
						skills were not strong then, and I needed to start from the basics. Slowly
						but surely, I acquired the skills, and now I masterfully wield the tools to
						bring my fantasies to life. The journey was challenging, but against the
						doubts of those around me, I succeeded and proved to myself that{' '}
						<strong>nothing is impossible.</strong> :)

						<strong>
							if you have something, do reach out, I'd be thrilled to discuss!

						). To immigrate to a country where I'd like to settle down and start a

						uncertain and searching for my place.
